## JSON Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used for data interchange. The project uses JSON to save and load transaction data.

- **JSON Syntax**: Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`, with keys as strings and values as strings, numbers, arrays, or nested objects.
- **Python and JSON**: Pythonâ€™s `json` library is used for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
